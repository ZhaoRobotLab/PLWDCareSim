Let's start the grocery shopping task by finding items on a shopping list.
Here is a grocery list. Please select the items on the list from the table.
Would you like the instructions repeated? Or would you like the instructions to be louder?
I'll read the list for you. We need to find a box of broccoli, a box of green peas, a box of spinach, and a box of green beans. Let's start by looking for the box of broccoli together.
The next shopping task is to pay for the groceries.
Here is a receipt for the 4 items and a wallet.
Use the wallet money to pay the exact amount for the groceries.
The total cost is $2.82. We need to pay the exact amount using the money in the wallet.
The next shopping task uses coupons.
Here are several food coupons in this envelope.
Check to see if any coupons match the items you purchased.
Here is your change. Did you get the correct change?
How much change should you have gotten?
The shopping task is done. Thank you for your work.
